-= What is this? =-

A collection of greasemonkey/userscripts I made for the Browser RPG
forumwarz. Some of them are improvements on scripts made by other
people and some are original scripts that I've made.

-= What's in this? =-

* "Hellban Script": Adds an "Ignore user" function for the main forums.
* BBCode Buttons: Adds BBCode buttons for the forums.
* "Domfag Script": A tool for the "Domination" minigame. You select a
                   list of forums to fight and then the script helps
                   you battle them one after the other easily.

-= Why put them on github? =-

For historical reasons. Plus as things are I'm tempted to host any
userscript I make on github rather than userscripts.org as the latter
tends to be slow and broken most of the time. At least here I can
track and modify things easily and when I want to.

I also put it here so people can fork the scripts and modify changes,
fixes etc although since I'm one of the few in the community that can
write JavaScript I doubt that anyone will put in some fixes.

-= Who are you again? =-

I'm known as "SanDyk" or "Johnald The Robot" which was the alt character
I used when announce any new script I made.
